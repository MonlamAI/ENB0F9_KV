A Supplication to the Master Himself: The Embodiment of Mañjughoṣa and Others To the glorious learned and realized master, The sole embodiment of the wisdom of knowledge, love, and power Of all the buddhas along with their descendants, Mañjughoṣa and others, From my heart I pray-look upon me with compassion! Arising as physical emanations from the dharmadhātu, Victorious in battle against hordes of obstacle-causing demons, And living in the essence of the three vajras, May you accomplish great benefit for the teachings and sentient beings! Added to the original self-authored supplication in one stanza is an additional verse by Lodrö Taye-a supplication for a swift return. May it be virtuous.
